Microscopic examination reveals cords of epithelial cells separated by vascular channels lined by discontinuous endothelial cells lacking a basement membrane. Which cell type resides within the luminal space of these vascular channels and functions as a resident macrophage?",

                lecture: "Histology of the Liver, Pancreas, and Gallbladder (Zhang)",
                lo: 1,
                rationale: "Kupffer cells are specialized macrophages located within the lumen of the liver sinusoids. They are part of the reticuloendothelial system and phagocytose bacteria, old red blood cells, and other debris from the portal blood. Hepatocytes form cords outside the lumen. Endothelial cells line the sinusoids but are not macrophages. Hepatic stellate cells are in the Space of Disse. (Source: Zhang, Slide 13)"

                lo: 2,
                rationale: "A portal triad (or portal tract) is found at the periphery of classic hepatic lobules and characteristically contains branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and a bile ductule, often accompanied by lymphatics and nerves, within connective tissue. The central vein is at the lobule center. Sinusoids are capillaries between hepatocytes. The Space of Disse is perisinusoidal. (Source: Zhang, Slide 8, 19)"

In which direction does bile flow relative to blood flow within a classic hepatic lobule?",

                lo: 3,
                rationale: "Bile flows within bile canaliculi centrifugally (away from the central vein) towards the bile ductules located in the portal triads at the periphery of the lobule. This is opposite to the direction of blood flow, which is centripetal (towards the central vein). (Source: Zhang, Slide 15, 16)"

One model describes a hexagonal unit with a central vein at its core and portal triads at the vertices, emphasizing blood flow towards the center. Another model emphasizes metabolic zonation based on oxygen supply, described as zones 1, 2, and 3 radiating from the portal triad. Which model corresponds to the hepatic acinus concept?",

                rationale: "The hepatic acinus is a functional unit emphasizing microcirculation and metabolic activity, defining zones (1, 2, 3) based on the oxygen/nutrient gradient radiating from the portal triad.

                lo: 5,
                rationale: "The gallbladder mucosa is characterized by numerous deep folds lined by a single layer of tall simple columnar epithelial cells specialized for water absorption. It lacks a muscularis mucosae and submucosa but does have smooth muscle in its wall. Brunner's glands are duodenal. Stratified squamous epithelium lines the esophagus. (Source: Zhang, Slide 33, 34)"

                rationale: "Islets of Langerhans are the endocrine component of the pancreas, appearing as distinct, pale-staining clusters of cells scattered throughout the exocrine tissue, responsible for producing hormones like insulin and glucagon. Acini are exocrine units. Centroacinar and intercalated duct cells are part of the exocrine duct system. (Source: Zhang, Slide 35, 42)"

The acinar cells are typically pyramidal with basal nuclei and characteristic staining patterns reflecting abundant rER (basal) and secretory granules (apical). Islets are endocrine. Ducts transport secretions. Centroacinar cells are initial duct cells within acini. (Source: Zhang, Slide 36, 37)"
